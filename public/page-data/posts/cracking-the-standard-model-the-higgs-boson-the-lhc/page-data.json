Join us as we attempt to break down the complex paper that confirmed its existence at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and explore why this elusive particle is so important. This one was for sure a challenge, but we’ll try to make sense of the science behind it, explain the significance of the discovery, and discuss what it means for our understanding of the universe. Get ready for a deep dive into particle physics!</p>\n<p>The paper can be found <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> if you would like to follow along with the discussion.
