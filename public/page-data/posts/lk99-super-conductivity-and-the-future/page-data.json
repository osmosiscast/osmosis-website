We take a deep dive into the paper that made the mainstream media, and into the idea of the scientific method and why it works - even when the hype gets ahead of the evidence. We’ll unpack the science behind LK-99, discuss the potential real-world impacts of room-temperature superconductors, and examine how breakthroughs like these can reshape our future. Join us as we separate the facts from the fiction and explore what this discovery could mean for technology, energy and beyond.</p>\n<p>The paper discussed can be found <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> if you would like to follow along with the discussion. The rebuttal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">paper</a> from the Max Planck Institute may also be of interest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://osmosiscast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Osmosis</a> is hosted by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-mcmillan-metrology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jamie McMillan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/calum-morris-7015a028b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Calum Morris</a>.
