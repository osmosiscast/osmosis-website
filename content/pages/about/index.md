During initial conceptualisation of the Osmosis podcast we were interested in enabling:

- News of interesting scientific developments
- Relating the topics back to GCSE concepts

The podcast should be intellectually useful and enjoyable for listeners at any level of scientific understanding, they may be curious but are not an expert.

We landed on a format where we **take a scientific paper and break it down into digestible chunks**. We hope that you as a listener will be able to take away new understanding on a specific field of research.
