We're back, welcome to season 2! In this episode, we dive into some fantastic and cutting-edge techniques used in the security of intermediate-level waste containers. Today's paper is a bit of a Jamie-special. Join us as we explore the science behind these innovative methods and their crucial role in handling radioactive materials.

The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07816) if you would like to follow along with the discussion. We also mentioned another of Jamie's [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03395) on a similar topic.

[Osmosis](https://osmosiscast.com) is hosted by [Jamie McMillan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-mcmillan-metrology/) and [Calum Morris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calum-morris-7015a028b/). Find us where you find your podcasts or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Osmosiscast).
