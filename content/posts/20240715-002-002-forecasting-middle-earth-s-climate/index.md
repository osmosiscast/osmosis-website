In this episode we embark on a unique journey to the fictional world of Middle-Earth and the very non-fictional world of climate models. Discover how scientific techniques used to predict real-world weather patterns can be applied to the diverse regions of Middle Earth. Or listen to two 30 year old men talk about nerdy things!
