title: LK-99, Super Conductivity, and the future!

This week, we explore the exciting world of superconductivity and are late to the party discussing LK-99. We take a deep dive into the paper that made the mainstream media, and into the idea of the scientific method and why it works - even when the hype gets ahead of the evidence. We'll unpack the science behind LK-99, discuss the potential real-world impacts of room-temperature superconductors, and examine how breakthroughs like these can reshape our future. Join us as we separate the facts from the fiction and explore what this discovery could mean for technology, energy and beyond.

The paper discussed can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12008) if you would like to follow along with the discussion. The rebuttal [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06256) from the Max Planck Institute may also be of interest. 

[Osmosis](https://osmosiscast.com) is hosted by [Jamie McMillan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-mcmillan-metrology/) and [Calum Morris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calum-morris-7015a028b/). Find us where you find your podcasts or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Osmosiscast). If you would like to request a paper to be discussed on the show, get in touch.
