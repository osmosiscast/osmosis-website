In today's episode we explore a paper from the mid 90s all about buzzwords and haggis...this piece of academic satire had us both laughing and marvelling at the creativity of its approach to modelling the elusive highland haggis. Expect lots of laughs, bewilderment, and maybe a little bit of learning along the way!
